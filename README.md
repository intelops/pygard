Validation framework based on pydantic (optional CEL as well). 
> Inspired by our own project, GenVal, to make a pydantic-based validation framework open-source and agnostic so that everyone can share validation policies. This framework can be extended to support CEL, Rego (OPA or not OPA), or any other technology of your interest.
